Thousands of engravings and paintings, dating back over 10,000 years, depict a time when the Sahara was a lush savannah teeming with wildlife like elephants, giraffes, and crocodiles. These artworks provide a unique window into the evolution of human civilization and climate change. Visiting Tassili is a profound experience, requiring guided expeditions, often on foot or by camel, to navigate its rugged terrain. It is a place where time seems to stand still, offering silence and a deep connection to the ancient past.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/content_img/img_1765997389222_554.webp\"></p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"/assets/content_img/img_1765997396741_726.webp\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"/assets/content_img/img_1765997411967_891.webp\"></p>"
